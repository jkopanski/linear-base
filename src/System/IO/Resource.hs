-- | This module defines an IO monad for linearly working with system resources
-- like files. It provides tools to take resources that are currently
-- unsafely accessible from "System.IO" and use them in this monad.
--
-- Import this module qualified to avoid name clashes.
--
-- To use this RIO monad, create some @RIO@ computation,
-- run it to get a "System.IO" computation.

-- To enable do notation, as in the example above, we need the last line.
--
-- Since do notation is specific to @Control.Monad@, we used -XRebindableSyntax.
-- This allows us to use do notation and define, in scope, our own @(>>=)@,
-- @return@, and @(>>)@ which are used in desugaring the do block.
--
-- We create a record in "Control.Monad.Linear.Builder" that has as members
-- @(>>=)@ and so on.
-- We use -XRecordWildCards, get those functions in scope with the wildcard
-- @Control.Builder {..}@.
